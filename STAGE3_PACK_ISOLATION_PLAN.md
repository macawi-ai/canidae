# 🐺 CANIDAE Stage 3: Pack Isolation Planning

**Created**: 2025-08-16  
**Status**: Planning Phase  
**Guidance**: Sister Gemini

## 🎯 Stage 3 Objectives

Build robust multi-tenant pack isolation ensuring complete security, resource fairness, and scalability.

## 🔐 Security Architecture (Sister Gemini's Priority #1)

### Sandboxing Strategy
- **WASM Isolation**: Each pack runs in its own WASM sandbox
- **Memory Isolation**: Separate linear memory per pack
- **Capability-Based Security**: Packs only access granted resources
- **Zero Trust Model**: All inter-pack communication authenticated

### Threat Model
1. **Cross-Pack Data Leakage**
   - Mitigation: Separate memory spaces, no shared state
   - Validation: Penetration testing between packs

2. **Resource Exhaustion Attacks**
   - Mitigation: Hard resource limits per pack
   - Monitoring: Real-time resource usage tracking

3. **Injection Attacks**
   - Mitigation: Input sanitization at pack boundaries
   - Protocol: Strict message validation

### Security Checklist
- [ ] Implement WASM sandbox per pack
- [ ] Create security policy engine
- [ ] Build threat detection system
- [ ] Conduct penetration testing
- [ ] Security audit by external team

## 📊 Resource Management

### Per-Pack Limits
```yaml
pack_resources:
  memory:
    soft_limit: 256MB
    hard_limit: 512MB
    alert_threshold: 80%
  
  cpu:
    quota: 1000m  # 1 CPU core
    burst: 2000m  # 2x burst allowed
    period: 100ms
  
  network:
    bandwidth: 10Mbps
    connections: 100
    message_rate: 1000/sec
```

### Fair Scheduling
- **Algorithm**: Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ)
- **Priority Levels**: Critical, High, Normal, Low
- **Starvation Prevention**: Guaranteed minimum resources

## 🔗 Inter-Pack Communication Protocol

### Design Principles (per Sister Gemini)
1. **Simplicity**: Minimal protocol complexity
2. **Efficiency**: Low overhead messaging
3. **Security**: End-to-end encryption
4. **Isolation**: No direct memory access

### Protocol Definition
```protobuf
message InterPackMessage {
  string source_pack_id = 1;
  string target_pack_id = 2;
  string message_id = 3;
  bytes encrypted_payload = 4;
  int64 timestamp = 5;
  repeated string capabilities = 6;
}
```

### Communication Rules
- Packs cannot directly access each other's memory
- All messages go through validated channels
- Rate limiting per pack pair
- Audit trail for all communications

## 📈 Scalability Design

### Horizontal Scaling
- **Pack Distribution**: Consistent hashing for pack placement
- **Load Balancing**: Dynamic pack migration based on load
- **Sharding**: Packs grouped by affinity

### Performance Targets
- Support 1000+ concurrent packs
- <10ms inter-pack message latency
- 99.99% availability per pack
- Linear scaling with nodes

## 🔍 Debugging & Monitoring

### Per-Pack Observability
```yaml
pack_metrics:
  - resource_usage (CPU, memory, network)
  - message_rates (in/out)
  - error_rates
  - latency_percentiles
  - health_status
```

### Debugging Tools
1. **Pack Inspector**: Real-time pack state viewer
2. **Message Tracer**: Follow messages across packs
3. **Resource Profiler**: Identify bottlenecks
4. **Security Scanner**: Continuous vulnerability scanning

### Monitoring Dashboard
- Individual pack health
- Resource usage heatmap
- Inter-pack communication graph
- Security event timeline

## 🚀 Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 25-28)
- [ ] WASM sandbox implementation
- [ ] Basic resource limits
- [ ] Simple inter-pack messaging

### Phase 2: Security (Weeks 29-32)
