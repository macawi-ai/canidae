## Current Sprint: Stage 1 - Core Ring (Weeks 1-12)

### Session: 2025-08-16 (Extended)

**Completed Today:**
- ‚úÖ Repository structure created (pure Go architecture)
- ‚úÖ NATS message bus integration with JetStream
- ‚úÖ HOWL protocol defined in protobuf
- ‚úÖ Robust flow control system implemented:
  - Leaky bucket rate limiting per provider
  - Circuit breakers with exponential backoff
  - Priority lanes (critical/high/medium/low)
- ‚úÖ Chaos Monkey for resilience testing
- ‚úÖ Project management structure defined with Sister Gemini
- ‚úÖ GitHub repository created at macawi-ai/canidae
- ‚úÖ CI/CD pipeline configured with security scanning
- ‚úÖ ADR system established for architecture decisions
- ‚úÖ **DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION SERVER** (192.168.1.38)
  - CANIDAE Ring orchestrator running on port 8080
  - NATS JetStream active on port 4222
  - Health endpoints responding
- ‚úÖ **MONITORING STACK DEPLOYED**
  - Prometheus on port 9091
  - Grafana on port 3001 (admin/canidae)
- ‚úÖ **CRITICAL DOCUMENTATION CREATED**
  - CONTRIBUTING.md with full contributor guidelines
  - DEPLOYMENT.md with comprehensive deployment guide
  - SECURITY.md with security policies
- ‚úÖ Server configuration completed:
  - canidae user for rootless Podman
  - Sudo permissions configured
  - Directory structure in /opt/canidae
  - Podman containers running

**Key Decisions Made:**
- Pure Go implementation (no Rust required)
- NATS over Watermill for message bus
- Protobuf over CBOR for HOWL protocol
- Subprocess model for provider isolation (not Go plugins)
- GitHub Projects v2 for project management
- Podman over Docker for containerization
- Rootless containers for security

**Current Focus:**
- Fix type issues in ring.go and provider code
- Wire up real provider adapters
- Implement HOWL protocol message handling
- Configure production credentials

**Blockers:**
- Type mismatches in provider interfaces need resolution

**Next Session Plan:**
1. Fix compilation issues in ring.go
2. Implement real provider adapters (OpenAI/Anthropic)
3. Set up HOWL protocol message routing
4. Create integration tests
5. Configure flow control in production

## Architecture Decisions Queue
1. Provider isolation: subprocess vs plugins (DECIDED: subprocess)
2. Database choice for persistence (PostgreSQL likely)
3. Kubernetes vs Docker Swarm for orchestration
4. Authentication provider (Auth0 vs Cognito vs custom)

---

## Bug Reports
None yet - still in initial development

## Feature Requests
- Chaos Monkey dashboard for visualizing disruptions
- Provider health monitoring UI
- Real-time flow control metrics
