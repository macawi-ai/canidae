# CANIDAE SDK Production Readiness Plan

Based on Sister Gemini's expert guidance, this document outlines our path to a bulletproof, production-ready SDK.

## 🎯 Priority 1: Foundation (Immediate)

### 1. Error Handling Enhancement ⚡
- [ ] Implement centralized error registry with error codes
- [ ] Add structured logging with correlation IDs (use zerolog)
- [ ] Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Add circuit breaker pattern for resilience
- [ ] Create error telemetry integration

### 2. Security Audit 🔒
- [ ] Run staticcheck on entire codebase
- [ ] Run gosec security scanner
- [ ] Implement Semgrep custom rules
- [ ] Perform dependency vulnerability scan
- [ ] Add client-side rate limiting
- [ ] Document certificate rotation strategy

### 3. Test Coverage Improvement (50.7% → 70%+) ✅
- [ ] Add connection error tests (timeouts, TLS failures)
- [ ] Test authentication/authorization failures
- [ ] Add data validation edge cases
- [ ] Implement mock server for integration tests
- [ ] Test streaming scenarios (interruptions, large datasets)
- [ ] Add timeout and context cancellation tests
- [ ] Test concurrent operations with race detector

## 🎯 Priority 2: Configuration & Secrets (Next)

### 4. Configuration Evolution 🔧
- [ ] Integrate Viper for configuration management
- [ ] Support environment variables
- [ ] Add YAML/JSON config file support
- [ ] Implement configuration validation
- [ ] Add hot-reload capability (optional)

### 5. Secrets Management 🔐
- [ ] Integrate HashiCorp Vault client
- [ ] Remove hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Implement secure credential storage
- [ ] Add certificate management

## 🎯 Priority 3: Observability (Following)

### 6. Monitoring & Logging 📊
- [ ] Implement comprehensive structured logging
- [ ] Add correlation ID propagation
- [ ] Create metrics collection (Prometheus)
- [ ] Set up distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)
- [ ] Add performance profiling hooks

### 7. Audit Logging 📝
- [ ] Define audit events
- [ ] Implement secure audit log storage
- [ ] Add retention policies
- [ ] Ensure compliance (GDPR, SOC2)

## 🎯 Priority 4: WASM Strategy (After Foundation)

### 8. WASM Implementation 🌐
- [ ] Evaluate TinyGo vs Standard Go
- [ ] Implement TypeScript wrapper
- [ ] Use Web Streams API for efficient streaming
- [ ] Consider WASI for system access
- [ ] Profile and optimize binary size

## 📋 Sister Gemini's Production Checklist

1. ✅ **Comprehensive Error Handling** - Centralized registry, structured logging, retry logic
2. ✅ **Security Audit** - Static analysis, vulnerability scanning, penetration testing
3. ✅ **Secrets Management** - HashiCorp Vault integration
4. ✅ **Configuration Management** - Viper integration with hot-reload
5. ✅ **Robust Testing** - 70%+ coverage, focus on errors and edge cases
6. ✅ **Monitoring & Alerting** - Metrics, logs, traces
7. ✅ **Logging** - Comprehensive with correlation IDs
8. ✅ **Rate Limiting** - Client and server side
9. ✅ **Documentation** - API docs, examples, troubleshooting
10. ✅ **Deployment Strategy** - Update distribution, rollback procedures

## 🔍 Specific Test Coverage Areas (per Sister Gemini)

### Critical Error Paths to Test:
- Connection errors (network timeouts, DNS failures, TLS handshake)
- Authentication/authorization errors
- Data validation errors
- Resource exhaustion scenarios
- Rate limiting/throttling responses
- Protocol errors (malformed messages)

### Edge Cases to Prioritize:
- Empty/null values
- Boundary conditions (max/min values)
- Concurrent operations
- Partial failures
- Idempotency verification

### Integration Test Requirements:
- Mock server implementation (use httptest or gomock)
- Simulate realistic server behaviors
- Test various response codes and latencies
- Verify request/response correctness

### Streaming & Timeout Testing:
- Large dataset streaming
- Interrupted streams
- Error handling during streaming
- Various timeout configurations
- Context propagation verification

## 🛠️ Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
1. Implement error registry and structured logging
2. Run security audits and fix critical issues
3. Increase test coverage to 70%+

### Phase 2: Configuration (Week 3)
4. Integrate Viper
5. Add HashiCorp Vault support

### Phase 3: Observability (Week 4)
6. Add monitoring and metrics
7. Implement audit logging

### Phase 4: WASM (Week 5-6)
8. Evaluate and implement WASM strategy
9. Create TypeScript wrapper
10. Optimize for browser performance

## 📊 Success Metrics

- **Test Coverage**: ≥70% for main client
- **Security**: Zero critical vulnerabilities
- **Performance**: <100ms connection time
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with circuit breaker
- **Error Rate**: <0.1% for transient failures (with retry)
- **Documentation**: 100% API coverage

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Create error registry package
2. Integrate zerolog for structured logging
3. Add missing test cases for error paths
4. Run staticcheck and gosec
5. Set up mock server for integration tests
