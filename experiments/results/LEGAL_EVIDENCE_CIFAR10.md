- **Handwritten Digits**: MNIST (28x28x1) - 100% compliance
- **Synthetic Shapes**: dSprites (64x64x1) - 99.9% compliance

### 2. PERFORMANCE METRICS (CIFAR-10)

#### 2π Regulated Model
- **Compliance Rate**: 100%
- **Final Loss**: 1744.245065168901
- **Convergence**: Epoch 1 (rapid)
- **Stability**: Maintained through 10 epochs
- **Violations**: 8 → 0 (perfect correction)

#### Baseline Comparisons
| Model Type | Loss | Compliance | Relative Performance |
|------------|------|------------|---------------------|
| 2π Regulated | 1744.25 | 100% | **BEST** |
| Standard VAE | 1838.60 | 0% | +5.4% worse |
| Beta-VAE | 1839.38 | 0% | +5.5% worse |
