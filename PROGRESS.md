## Current Sprint: Stage 1 - Core Ring (Weeks 1-12)

### Session: 2025-08-16

**Completed Today:**
- ‚úÖ Repository structure created (pure Go architecture)
- ‚úÖ NATS message bus integration with JetStream
- ‚úÖ HOWL protocol defined in protobuf
- ‚úÖ Robust flow control system implemented:
  - Leaky bucket rate limiting per provider
  - Circuit breakers with exponential backoff
  - Priority lanes (critical/high/medium/low)
- ‚úÖ Chaos Monkey for resilience testing
- ‚úÖ Project management structure defined with Sister Gemini
- ‚úÖ GitHub repository created at macawi-ai/canidae
- ‚úÖ CI/CD pipeline configured with security scanning
- ‚úÖ ADR system established for architecture decisions

**Key Decisions Made:**
- Pure Go implementation (no Rust required)
- NATS over Watermill for message bus
- Protobuf over CBOR for HOWL protocol
- Subprocess model for provider isolation (not Go plugins)
- GitHub Projects v2 for project management

**Current Focus:**
- Setting up GitHub project infrastructure
- Creating ADR documentation system
- Implementing provider adapter pattern

**Blockers:**
- None currently

**Next Session Plan:**
1. Complete GitHub project setup
2. Implement first provider adapter (OpenAI or Anthropic)
3. Create integration tests for flow control
4. Set up CI/CD pipeline

---

## Architecture Decisions Queue
1. Provider isolation: subprocess vs plugins (DECIDED: subprocess)
2. Database choice for persistence (PostgreSQL likely)
3. Kubernetes vs Docker Swarm for orchestration
4. Authentication provider (Auth0 vs Cognito vs custom)

---

## Bug Reports
None yet - still in initial development

## Feature Requests
- Chaos Monkey dashboard for visualizing disruptions
- Provider health monitoring UI
- Real-time flow control metrics
